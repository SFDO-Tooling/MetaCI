Development Setup
=================

Cloning the project
-------------------

::

    git clone git@github.com:SFDO-Tooling/MetaCI
    cd MetaCI

Making a virtual env
--------------------

MetaCI development requires Python v3.7. If ``which python3.7`` returns a
non-empty path, it's already installed and you can continue to the next step. If
it returns nothing, then install Python v3.7 using ``brew install python``, or
from `Python.org`_.

.. _Python.org: https://www.python.org/downloads/

There are a variety of tools that let you set up environment variables
temporarily for a particular "environment" or directory. We use
`virtualenvwrapper`_. Assuming you're in the repo root, do the following to
create a virtualenv (once you have `virtualenvwrapper`_ installed locally)::

    mkvirtualenv metaci --python=$(which python3.7)
    setvirtualenvproject

Install Python requirements::

    pip install -r requirements/local.txt

Copy the ``.env`` file to config/settings/.env::

    cp env.example config/settings/.env

Edit this file to fill in values for the missing settings, especially
GITHUB_USERNAME and GITHUB_PASSWORD. You will need to use a
`Personal Access Token`_ instead of a password if you have 2-factor
authentication set up.

Now run ``workon metaci`` to set those environment variables.

Your ``PATH`` (and environment variables) will be updated when you
``workon metaci`` and restored when you ``deactivate``. This will make sure
that whenever you are working on the project, you use the project-specific version of Node
instead of any system-wide Node you may have.

**All of the remaining steps assume that you have the virtualenv activated
(``workon metaci}}``).**

Installing JavaScript requirements
----------------------------------

The project-local version of `Node.js`_ is bundled with the repo and can be
unpacked locally (in the git-ignored ``node/`` directory), so you don't have to
install it system-wide (and possibly conflict with other projects wanting other
Node versions).

To install the project-local version of Node (and `yarn`_)::

    bin/unpack-node

If you can run ``which node`` and see a path inside your project directory ending with
``.../node/bin/node``, then you've got it set up right and can move on.

Then use ``yarn`` to install dependencies::

    yarn

.. _Node.js: http://nodejs.org
.. _yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/

Setting up the database
-----------------------

Assuming you have `Postgres <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>`_ installed
and running locally::

    createdb metaci

Then run the initial migrations::

    ./manage.py migrate

Run this command if you would like to populate the database with fake testing
data:

    ./manage.py populate_db

Run this command to create a necessary repeatable django-rq job in the database::

    ./manage.py metaci_scheduled_jobs


Creating a superuser
--------------------

To use the Django admin UI, you'll need to create a superuser::

    ./manage.py createsuperuser


Running the server
------------------

The local development server requires `Redis <https://redis.io/>`_ to manage
background worker tasks. If you can successfully run ``redis-cli ping`` and see
output ``PONG``, then you have Redis installed and running. Otherwise, run
``brew install redis`` (followed by ``brew services start redis``) or refer to
the `Redis Quick Start`_.

To run the local development server::

    yarn serve

This starts a process running Django, a process running Node, and an ``rq`` worker process.
The running server will be available at `<http://localhost:8080/>`_.

.. _Redis Quick Start: https://redis.io/topics/quickstart

Development Tasks
-----------------

- ``yarn serve``: starts development server (with watcher) at
  `<http://localhost:8080/>`_ (assets are served from ``dist/`` dir)
- ``yarn pytest``: run Python tests
- ``yarn test``: run JS tests
- ``yarn test:watch``: run JS tests with a watcher for development
- ``yarn lint``: formats and lints ``.scss`` and ``.js`` files; lints ``.py``
  files
- ``yarn prettier``: formats ``.scss`` and ``.js`` files
- ``yarn eslint``: lints ``.js`` files
- ``yarn flow``: runs JS type-checking
- ``yarn stylelint``: lints ``.scss`` files
- ``yarn flake8``: lints ``.py`` files
- ``yarn build``: builds development (unminified) static assets into ``dist/``
  dir
- ``yarn prod``: builds production (minified) static assets into ``dist/prod/``
  dir

In commit messages or pull request titles, we use the following emojis to label
which development commands need to be run before serving locally (these are
automatically prepended to commit messages):

- 📦 (``:package:``) -> ``pip install -r requirements/local.txt``
- 🛢 (``:oil_drum:``) -> ``python manage.py migrate``
- 🐈 (``:cat2:``) -> ``yarn``
- 🙀 (``:scream_cat:``) -> ``rm -rf node_modules/; bin/unpack-node; yarn``

Internationalization
--------------------

To build and compile ``.mo`` and ``.po`` files for the backend, run::

   $ python manage.py makemessages --locale <locale>
   $ python manage.py compilemessages

These commands require the `GNU gettext toolset`_ (``brew install gettext``).

For the front-end, translation JSON files are served from
``locales/<language>/`` directories, and the `user language is auto-detected at
runtime`_.

During development, strings are parsed automatically from the JS, and an English
translation file is auto-generated to ``locales_dev/en/translation.json`` on
every build (``yarn build`` or ``yarn serve``). When this file changes,
translations must be copied over to the ``locales/en/translation.json`` file in
order to have any effect.

Strings with dynamic content (i.e. known only at runtime) cannot be
automatically parsed, but will log errors while the app is running if they're
missing from the served translation files. To resolve, add the missing key:value
translations to ``locales/<language>/translation.json``.

Developing with SLDS
--------------------

MetaCI uses https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/django-slds which imports version 2.1.2 of the Salesforce Lightning Design System.
