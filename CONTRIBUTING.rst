Developing MetaCI
=================

MetaCI can be setup using either docker virtual containers
or on your local machine. 
 
Using Docker
============

To set up MetaCI using docker please
see the following instructions `<./docs/RUNNING_DOCKER.rst>`_.


Using Local Machine
===================

As mentioned above, MetaCI can be configured locally. 
To achieve this follow the instructions provided in `<./docs/RUNNING.rst>`_.

Running the Server
==================
Docker runs the server automatically. If you are not using Docker for 
development, you can run it like this:

- ``yarn serve``: starts development server (with watcher) at
  `<http://localhost:8080/>`_ (assets are served from ``dist/`` dir)

Development Tasks
=================

To run these tests with docker first run the following commands, 

::

    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose exec web bash

If you are not using docker or are using the VS Code integrated terminal 
inside the Docker container simply execute the commands in your project's 
root directory:

- ``yarn pytest``: run Python tests
- ``yarn test``: run JS tests
- ``yarn test:watch``: run JS tests with a watcher for development
- ``yarn lint``: formats and lints ``.scss`` and ``.js`` files; lints ``.py``
  files
- ``yarn prettier``: formats ``.scss`` and ``.js`` files
- ``yarn eslint``: lints ``.js`` files
- ``yarn flow``: runs JS type-checking
- ``yarn stylelint``: lints ``.scss`` files
- ``yarn flake8``: lints ``.py`` files
- ``yarn build``: builds development (unminified) static assets into ``dist/``
  dir
- ``yarn prod``: builds production (minified) static assets into ``dist/prod/``
  dir
- ``tsc``: check that there are no type errors in the Javascript

Commits
=======

In commit messages or pull request titles, we use the following emojis to label
which development commands need to be run before serving locally (these are
automatically prepended to commit messages):

- 📦 (``:package:``) -> ``pip install -r requirements/local.txt``
- 🛢 (``:oil_drum:``) -> ``python manage.py migrate``
- 🐈 (``:cat2:``) -> ``yarn``
- 🙀 (``:scream_cat:``) -> ``rm -rf node_modules/; bin/unpack-node; yarn``

Internationalization
====================

To build and compile ``.mo`` and ``.po`` files for the backend, run::

   $ python manage.py makemessages --locale <locale>
   $ python manage.py compilemessages

These commands require the `GNU gettext toolset`_ (``brew install gettext``).

For the front-end, translation JSON files are served from
``locales/<language>/`` directories, and the `user language is auto-detected at
runtime`_.

During development, strings are parsed automatically from the JS, and an English
translation file is auto-generated to ``locales_dev/en/translation.json`` on
every build (``yarn build`` or ``yarn serve``). When this file changes,
translations must be copied over to the ``locales/en/translation.json`` file in
order to have any effect.

Strings with dynamic content (i.e. known only at runtime) cannot be
automatically parsed, but will log errors while the app is running if they're
missing from the served translation files. To resolve, add the missing key:value
translations to ``locales/<language>/translation.json``.

Developing with SLDS
====================

MetaCI uses https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/django-slds which imports version 2.1.2 of the Salesforce Lightning Design System.
